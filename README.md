# [marvin.henssler.me](https://marvin.henssler.me) - Frontend

Personal webpage for the Hen√üler family. Still in development.
This project was developed with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.1.
Icons used are part of the free version of [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The website is hosted by github pages, available [here](https://marvin.henssler.me). The hosted site consists only of the angular frontend. I have [another repository](https://github.com/Rexjurgoran/website/) that contains a compatible backend written in go. It can run as a container available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/rexjurgoran/website-backend/general).
